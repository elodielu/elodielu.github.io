			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>你好，我是鲁冰洁！</p>
			<p>Hello, I am Bingjie Lu!</p>
			<p>Bonjour, je suis Élodie!</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">If I were to describe myself in one word, I would pick <em>international</em>. Being a <b>Chinese</b> girl, I studied <b>North American</b> Accounting, both IFRS and GAAP, in college. After that I went to <b>France</b> for my first master degree in International Accounting and Finance. Thanks to this amazing year in paradise-like Cote d’Azure(picture above is the Mediterranean sea I had one block from my apartment), I also got the chance to travel around <b>Europe</b> and learnt snowboarding in Mont Alps. Now I am in Minneapolis MN,<b>US</b>, paying my debt to the snow queen...15.8 inches of snow in April, seriously?<br><br>

Inspired by my consulting internship in Shanghai, I saw the business world’s craving for data-driven decisions and I myself am also much more comfortable giving my recommendations backed by data. Therefore, I am on my second master degree in Business Analytics, connecting business, statistics and machine learning!<br><br>
Also, Corgi Lover!!
